# Networking Infrastructure Documentation

This repository contains detailed documentation for a full LAN/WAN enterprise network project. The network is designed with scalability, security, and reliability in mind, including proper subnetting, server setup, routing protocols, and regular maintenance planning.

## Project Report

The file `networking report.docx` includes:

- Subnetting Plans – IP addressing with growth forecasting
- LAN/WAN Architecture – Full-mesh topology with routers, switches, and Wi-Fi
- Server Configurations – Static IP setup for:
  - DHCP
  - FTP
  - Email
  - HTTP (HTTPS-only enabled)
  - DNS
- Security Practices – Router passwords, service restrictions, and future recommendations
- Connectivity Testing – Ping, nslookup, FTP transfers, and more
- Test Plan – Commands used, expected results, and outcomes
- Maintenance Checklist – Daily, weekly, and monthly tasks
- Enhancement Suggestions – Speed, redundancy, password policy, scalability

## Test Scenarios

- ping connectivity tests across LANs and WAN
- Email sending and receiving simulation
- FTP upload and download verification
- DNS name resolution with nslookup
- HTTP and HTTPS response testing
- DHCP auto-assignment validation

## Future Improvements

- Add firewall protections
- Use unique, strong passwords per user and device
- Add network monitoring tools
- Expand with minimal subnetting changes
